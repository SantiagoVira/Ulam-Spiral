# Ulam-Spiral
 Ulam Spiral generator in python built in two ways (Pygame and Turtle)

## Background
 [The Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) depicts a square spiral of `n x n` size. Each cell in the spiral is a subsequent positive integer, 1 being the center/starting point. As the spiral goes around, prime numbers are highlighted with a dot, their numeric value, or some other form of displaying them. As the spiral gets larger a `"striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes."` begins to reveal itself.
 
 
## Usage
 - Both versions have clearly marked spots to cuztomize the spiral given
 - Depending on the size selected, the spirals will most likely take a few seconds to generate
 - Enjoy!
